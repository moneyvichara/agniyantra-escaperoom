The Agni Yantra: Final Protocol is an HTML-based escape room challenge set on a failing space station. A Maya virus has crippled the systemsâ€”oxygen is depleting, temperatures are rising, and power is fading. To survive, you must solve a series of engaging puzzles, including decoding ancient symbols, aligning energy grids, and cracking numeric codes, all through a web browser. Activate the escape pod before time runs out. The game is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and requires no installation. Dive in, think quickly, and escape!
